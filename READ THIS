### **Hello! Regarding AVURNA & Collaboration Inquiry 👋**

Hey @Bancroftencouraging198, Godwin here!

I noticed you recently added me as a contributor to `avurna-ai` after seeing my public project, and I wanted to reach out.

I'm genuinely thrilled you found the project inspiring enough to create a public version and add me! I'd love to hear your initial thoughts on it and what aspects caught your eye.

I'm keen to explore the possibility of collaborating on this. Do you have any specific ideas or directions you'd like to take it? I'm open to discussing how we could push this forward together.

Let me know your thoughts – looking forward to hearing from you!
